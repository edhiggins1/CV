  <h4>Personal Profile:</h4>
  <p>An enthusiastic and driven biological sciences graduate and former Laboratory Assistant Manager with excellent written, analytical and verbal communication skills which has developed through three years of university and two years of working
    in a private COVID-19 laboratory. Obtained strong problem solving and leadership skills during my time as a Laboratory Assistant Manger which additionally built upon a capability to understand protocols and procedures quickly and with high
    accuracy. Evidence of these skills are validated via two promotions within a year at my last place of work. Recently began a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">python bootcamp</a> and am interested in applying these
    programming skills and my knowledge of biology to a career in data
    science, where I can aid company growth and further develop my knowledge and skill set.</p>
